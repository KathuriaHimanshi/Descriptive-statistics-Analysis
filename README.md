# Descriptive-statistics-Analysis

# Problem Statement

The company is launching a `marketing campaign` but it wants to target its audience properly.
The management suspects after some shore analysis marketing results can be improved without the need of investing additional resources.
We will `perform data analysis and identify which groups of people are most likely to buy our product`.
Once we have done so marketing team can focus its efforts on these groups.

# Data Description
The table has two parts
1. On the `left hand side` we have `product information `
2. On the `right hand side` we have `customer information`

All products are listed but customer information is only available for some products. `This is because we input information about a customer once the deal is done logically only sold items are associated with a buyer`.

# Understanding data through one instance.

`Nora Lynch` with a `customer id C004` was `56 years` old `when she bought an apartment 43` in `building 1` to live there. She `paid 377,313 .56 dollars` for an `area of 1160.36 square feet` In `June 2004`. Nora is from `California`. Felt `very satisfied` with the deal and `did not get a mortgage for the purchase`. She `found` out about `product through our website`.


# Steps of Data Analysis

### Step 1: Identify types of data and levels of measurement for some useful Variable/Column.

| Variable |      Type of Data      |  Level of measurement |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
|ID |  Categorical | Qualitative Nominal |
| Age |    Numerical-Discrete(In this case only)   |   Quantitative Ratio |
| Age Interval | Numerical-Discrete |    Qualitative Ordinal |
| Price | Numerical-Continuous |    Quantitative Ratio |
| Gender | Categorical |    Qualitative Nominal |
| State | Categorical |    Qualitative Nominal |

### Step 2: Analyse each variable (As in the [Excel](https://github.com/KathuriaHimanshi/Real-Estate-Market-Segmentation/blob/master/365%20REAL%20ESTATE%20MARKET%20SEGMENTATION.xlsx))
### Step 3: Find relationship between variables – look at excel sheets
### Step 4: Find Insights

1.	Males are more likely to sign contracts and are potentially a better audience for our ads. However we have no information about their marital status. This observation is unclear.
2.	68 percent of our sales in the US come from California with Nevada Oregon Arizona and Colorado following behind to form 93 percent of the US customer base 
3.	71 percent of sales were made with customers aged between 26 and 55 years old with a mean of 46 years of age and a standard deviation of 13 years. The distribution is right skewed so we expect younger people to buy more property than older people.
4.	Finally there is no relationship between the age of a customer and the price they will pay.
